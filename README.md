<h5>About Musician Finder</h5>
<p>The purpose of musician finder is to make it easier to search for and find information about your favorite artists.

They can also see reviews and blog post about their chosen artists, which are sourced from EchoNest. Combining all these features into one web app makes it easier for users to get all the info about the artist they are looking for because everything is in one place!</p>
